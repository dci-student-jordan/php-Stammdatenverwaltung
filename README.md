# php-Stammdatenverwaltung

*learning php during my internship as part of my Python Backend Developer Course at the DCI*

This is an application for managing appartments in a fictional housing association.

Registered users can manage appartments, rooms and the inventory with automated assistance such as email or postal code verification, the appartment's size comparison of contained rooms or a defined standard of the inventory generating an offer to update it etc.

Admins can also manage users.

To test make sure you have php, mysql and a local server installed (with for example xammp), run the wohnungen.sql to create and populate the database and log in as bobby.blue@buddy, pw bgt56789.
