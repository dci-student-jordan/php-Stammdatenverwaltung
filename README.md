# php-Stammdatenverwaltung

*learning php during my internship as part of my Python Backend Developer Course at the DCI*

This is an application for managing appartments in a fictional housing association.

Registered users can manage appartments, rooms and the inventory with automated assistance such as email or postal code verification, the appartment's size comparison of contained rooms or a defined standard of the inventory generating an offer to update it etc.

Admins can also manage users.

To test you can simply have a look at the demo [here](https://stammdatenwebdeploy-production.up.railway.app/) or run "docker compose up --build" and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Else make sure you have php, mysql and a local server installed (with for with example xampp), run the wohnungen.sql to create and populate the database.
Then log in as bobby.blue@buddy, pw bgt56789.
